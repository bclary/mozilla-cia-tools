"""This module implements a caching system for the data downloaded
from Bugzilla and Treeherder. It is mean to be transparent to callers.

Possible directory layout

    bugzilla

        <repository>
            pushes
            jobs
            jobdetails

Whenever a request is made for a supported object, the caller will ask
the cache system if the object is already available and if so it will
be loaded from disk and returned to the caller. If it does not exist,
the caller will be responsible for requesting the object from its
source then calling the cache system to save it for later use.

The appropriate place for this caching check is in the get_ functions
which request specific objects. Thes functions can have the locations
of the potential cached objects encoded in them and they can pass
this information to the cache system in order to locate the requested
objects.
